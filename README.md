# Cookie Sales Tracker

This C++ program tracks cookie sales for multiple classes and determines the winning class based on the most boxes sold. It processes sales data from a file containing 1,000 items, accumulates the totals for each class, and outputs the results in a table format.

## Key Features:
- **Reads Sales Data**: Processes class names and box sales from `boxes.dat` (with 1,000 entries).
- **Calculates Totals**: Tracks the total number of boxes sold by each class.
- **Displays Results**: Outputs a formatted table and announces the winning class.
- **Extra Credit**: Adds sorting to display classes in order of sales.

## Example Output:
```bash
The final results are:
Lion              4338              
Eagle             5068
